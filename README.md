## Overview

Ledger Nano devices are the perfect hardware wallets for managing your crypto & NFTs on the go.
This Flutter package is a plugin for the [ledger_flutter_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/ledger_flutter_plus) package to get accounts and sign transactions using the Cardano blockchain.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install the latest version of this package via pub.dev:

```yaml
ledger_cardano_plus: ^latest-version
ledger_flutter_plus: ^latest-version
```

For integration with the Ledger Flutter Plus package, check out the documentation [here](https://pub.dev/packages/ledger_flutter_plus).

### Setup and Usage

Get an instance of an `CardanoLedger` and then use it to scan and connect to devices.

```dart
final CardanoLedger cardanoLedgerConnector = CardanoLedger.ble(
    onPermissionRequest: (status) async {
      // if ([AvailabilityState.unsupported].contains(status)) {
      //   return false;
      // }

      // this is using permission_handler package
      Map<Permission, PermissionStatus> statuses = await [
        Permission.location,
        Permission.bluetoothScan,
        Permission.bluetoothConnect,
        Permission.bluetoothAdvertise,
      ].request();

      return statuses.values.where((status) => status.isDenied).isEmpty;
    },
  );

// FOR USB
// final CardanoLedger cardanoLedgerConnector = CardanoLedger.usb();

final devicesStream = cardanoLedgerConnector.scanForDevices();

// Best is to actually listen to the stream and then allow the user to select
//  the wanted ledger device
final firstLedgerDevice = await devicesStream.first;

final cardanoApp = cardanoLedgerConnector.connect(firstLedgerDevice);

// To derive receive address
final receiveAddress = await cardanoApp.deriveReceiveAddress(
      addressIndex: addressIndex,
      network: CardanoNetwork.mainnet(),
    );
```

## Running Integration Tests

To run the integration tests for the `ledger-cardano-plus` SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   - Ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it from [Flutter's official site](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   - If you haven't already, clone the `ledger-cardano-plus` repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vespr-wallet/ledger-cardano-plus.git
   cd ledger-cardano-plus
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Integration Tests Directory:**

   - Change to the directory containing the integration tests:

   ```bash
   cd example/integration_test
   ```

4. **Set up ledger device with correct test recovery phrase**
   - abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about

5. **Run the Tests:**

   - Use the following Flutter command to execute all the integration tests:

   ```bash
   cd example
   flutter test integration_test/*_tests.dart
   ```

   - To run a specific integration test file, provide the path to the test file:

   ```bash
   cd example
   flutter test integration_test/sign_message_tests.dart
   flutter test integration_test/cardano_ledger_serial_version_tests.dart
   ```

   - To run a specific test case within a test file, use the `-n` flag followed by the test name:

   ```bash
   cd example
   flutter test integration_test/cardano_ledger_serial_version_tests.dart -n "Should correctly get the serial number of the device"
   ```

   Make sure your development environment is properly set up to communicate with the Ledger device, and that the device is connected and unlocked before running the tests.
